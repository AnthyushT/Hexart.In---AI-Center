The image classification project using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is involved of training a model to identify and classify the images. 
The CNN is taking an image as input and process it through multiple layers, including convolutional layers that extract features from the image, and fully connected layers that use those features to make a classification. 
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images and their corresponding classifications, and then tested on new images to evaluate its accuracy. 

This image classification project aims to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately determine whether an image is related to sadness or happiness. The project involves training a CNN model on a dataset of images labeled as either sad or happy, with the goal of achieving high accuracy in identifying the emotion associated with new, unseen images. 
The model will utilize various layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from the images and make predictions.

This project can have many practical applications, such as in emotion recognition systems for social media platforms and mental health tracking tools.

**Requirements:**

1. Python: The project is written in Python, so you will need to have Python installed on your system in order to run the code. 
2. TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It is used in this project to train the model.
3. Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It is used in this project to define the model architecture.
4. OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It is used in this project to read, resize and convert images to grayscale.
5. Other packages: The project also requires other packages such as numpy, matplotlib and sklearn. These packages can be installed using the package manager pip.
