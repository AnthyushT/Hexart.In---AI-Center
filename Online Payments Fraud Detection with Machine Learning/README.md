## Online Payments Fraud Detection
- I have developed a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. It uses the dataset from the European Credit Card Transactions, which contains over 284,807 transactions and 492 frauds. The project utilizes Python and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, modeling and evaluating the performance of the model.

- The project is divided into several stages, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. In the preprocessing stage, the data is cleaned, and outliers are removed. In the feature selection stage, the important feature has been chosen from the dataset. And in the final stage, the model is trained using Random Forest Classifier. The model uses an imbalanced dataset for handling it and to balance it I have used oversampling technique to improve the model's performance.

- Overall, the project is an implementation of a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using the European Credit Card Transactions dataset and various machine learning libraries and techniques. The goal of the project is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting fraudulent transactions, thus reducing financial losses for credit card companies and their customers.
